## ✨ Features

|           | What it means for you |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| **One-click install & uninstall** | Flip a switch to add or remove any mod—the manager copies files, updates logs, and cleans up after itself. |
| **Automatic Safety Backups** | Your original game files are duplicated the very first time you run the app, so you can always roll back. Ensure your files are Vanilla when first downloading. |
| **Live texture & 3-D model viewer** | Preview characters, camos, and textures in a Helix-powered 3-D window before installing. Like how a certain texture looks? Make it into a mod with a few easy clicks. |
| **Camo / face-paint / box swapper** | Don't like a camo a modder picked as a replacement for their MGS3 Camo/Box mod? Then change Snake’s camo, face-paint, or cardboard boxes in seconds by selecting what should be replaced. |
| **Guard-route editors** | Want make new scenarios or help out MGS2/3 Randomizer development? A visual editors for MGS2's *.hzx* and MGS3's *.geom* guard paths.|
| **Auto-download of modding tools** | CtxrTool, texconv, and other helpers are fetched automatically when you need them. |
